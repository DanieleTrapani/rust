# Learning Rust with "The Rust Programming Language"

Welcome to my repository for learning Rust using the book "The Rust Programming Language" by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols. This repository is a collection of exercises and projects that I've worked on while learning Rust. It serves as a way to track my progress and share my work with the community.

## About the Book

"The Rust Programming Language" (commonly known as the Rust Book) is an excellent resource for learning Rust. It's available for free online at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I highly recommend following along with the book if you're new to Rust.
